The preferred way to create a language start-point image is using tagged urls.  
Eg
```bash
   cyber-dojo start-point create ruby-all \
      --languages \
        0ca1b04@https://github.com/cyber-dojo-start-points/ruby-approval \
        bdbf761@https://github.com/cyber-dojo-start-points/ruby-cucumber \
        f618605@https://github.com/cyber-dojo-start-points/ruby-minitest \
        3371ebc@https://github.com/cyber-dojo-start-points/ruby-rspec    \
        b5e366e@https://github.com/cyber-dojo-start-points/ruby-testunit
```
Eg
```bash
  cyber-dojo start-point create cyberdojo/languages-start-points \
    --languages \
      $(cat git_repo_urls.tagged)
```
