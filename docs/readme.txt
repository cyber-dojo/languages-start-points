building and deploying a new languages-start-points image
is much slower than I would like. It is slow largely because it has
to clone each git-repo URL and some repos are big, eg contain jar files.
Possible redesign to make this much faster...

When, eg, cyber-dojo-languages/java-junit is in its CI pipe it:
o) creates its java-junit image as per currently
   eg cyberdojofoundation/java_junit
o) tags this image with the 1st 7 chars of the git commit sha
   eg cyberdojofoundation/java_junit:4edf92a
o) creates a _new_ image with a tag of :LSP
   which contains _only_ the start_point/ dir
   eg cyberdojofoundation/java_junit:LSP
   its manifest.json contains an tagged image_name as above :4edf92a


The creation of a new languages-start-points image (in its CI pipe is)
takes a list of plain docker image names, which are all :LSP tagged
images as above.

A new languages-start-point image is created by simply pulling all
the :LSP images and their start_point/ dirs are collected together
(like start-point-base does with its 0/1/2/3/4 index dirs) and a last
check is made that all display_names are unique.

Now we could just let image-names such as cyberdojofoundation/java_junit:4edf92a
get to the runner, which does an auto-pull which may timeout initially.

An improvement would be to hook into the k8s /ready? probe of
languages-start-points and get it to do a one-time only pull of the images.
Viz, pull all the named images, eg cyberdojofoundation/java_junit:4edf92a
Eg
   ready?
   if (/tmp/all-pulled marker file exists)
      200
   else
      pull them all
      create /tmp/all-pulled marker file
      200

With this you could of course get a 2nd, 3rd etc ready? request from
k8s while the 1st one is still completing.
If the ready? probe fails for too long does it enter the crash-loop-backoff?

languages-start-points then need to become a daemonSet.

How would this affect start-point creation using the cyber-dojo script?
At the moment, lcoally, I do things like
  $ cyber-dojo start-point create jj --languages $PWD
Does this need to be modified to also create the java_junit:4edf92a image?
I think that would be ok.
